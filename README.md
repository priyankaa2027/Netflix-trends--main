# Project 13: Netflix Viewing Trends

## Overview
This project analyzes Netflix viewing trends to uncover insights about genre popularity, content release patterns, and regional preferences. The analysis is visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard, enabling users to explore data by various filters and time periods.

## Objective
To analyze and visualize Netflix content trends over time, focusing on genres, release years, content types (Movie/TV), and countries.

## Features
- Data cleaning and transformation of genre, year, and type columns
- Interactive filters for content type (Movie/TV), genre, and country
- Time series analysis of content releases
- Visualizations for genre popularity and regional trends
- User-friendly dashboard for data exploration

## Tasks
- Clean and preprocess the dataset (remove duplicates, handle missing values, standardize columns)
- Create calculated columns and measures for analysis
- Design and implement interactive filters and slicers
- Build visualizations: bar charts, line graphs, maps, and tables
- Summarize key findings and insights

## Outcome
A comprehensive Power BI dashboard that allows users to:
